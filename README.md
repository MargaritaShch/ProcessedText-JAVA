# Java Task

## Project Overview

This project implements a task for processing a text file using Java. The primary goal is to modify the letters in the text and subsequently count the number of vowels and consonants. The program is designed to work with Cyrillic text, which can be useful for text data processing tasks in a Russian-speaking environment.

## Features Implemented

- **Text File Processing**: The program reads a text file, replaces all vowels with 'a' and all consonants with 'Ð¼'. The result is saved to a new file. The processing is done with Cyrillic text.
  
- **Letter Count and Output**: The program counts the number of vowels and consonants in the new file and prints these values.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. The source text file should be located in the specified directory. After running the program, it will read the source file, process the data, save the result to a new file, and print the information about the number of vowels and consonants to the console.
